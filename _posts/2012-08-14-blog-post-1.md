Hello everyone, this is my first post on this blog, actually it is my first post in general. There are many things I want to say, but I will state that this post will not contain anything technical or theoretical. As it will talk about me, I will also share anything interesting with you. In fact, I do it more for myself because I feel the need.

What will this post contain?
- Who am I
- What is this site
- Conclusions

======
My name is Flavio Campobasso, I‚Äôm from Rome, Italy, and I‚Äôm 22 years old. I studied at the Liceo scientifico scienze applicate, then with computer science instead of Latin, and now I am in my fourth year of computer engineering at the University of Rome Tor Vergata

<span style="color: #ce2323">What is this site</span>
======

The reason I opened this site is actually quite simple, that is I always liked the idea of having a personal site, made by me, where I could share my story, my ideas, my works and my passions. I also believe that a personal site for a software developer/ computer engineer is much more valid than a simple paper CV, not that even more fun of course. Not only that, I opened this site with the hope that it will motivate me more for study, in fact, because one of the things I want to do is share paper/ technical post about what I like or what I learn at university, I hope it helps me deepen things that I often can‚Äôt.

=====
Before I finish I want to say one last thing. Among the various things I want to try to write in English, both as training, and so that it can reach as many people as possible. That said, I promise nothing about fairness üòÅ. The second is that I hope it‚Äôs a trend that‚Äôs starting to go into fashion, this one about opening personal sites, I think it‚Äôs very nice.
