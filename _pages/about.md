Hey! I am flavio, I am a computer engineering student at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. This website is about learning and sharing. Here you will find ideas, insights and notes/articles to learn something new.

<span style="color: #ce2323">What's this website about?</span>
======
In this website, I will be mainly sharing things I am learning in my free time.

- System design  
- Machine learning  
- and more

All this resources are mainly for my own learning, but I figured Itâ€™d be good to share them in the public. In this way, I have something to keep myself in check and I can get some nice discussions going with interesting people.

======

I really like writing, so I will keep a little blog where I discuss everythig about my career, and where I will write updates about all the cool things I will be learning!
